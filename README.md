## 📋 Overview

A comprehensive implementation demonstrating Linux file system concepts and Docker bind mount configurations using NGINX. Built for DevOps engineers and system administrators seeking to master container volume management and file system operations.

This project bridges the gap between theoretical file system knowledge and practical container deployment, offering hands-on experience with bind mounts in production environments.

Current Status: Production-Ready ✅

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated bind mount configuration leveraging Linux's unified tree structure for seamless container-host file sharing.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Linux Operating System
- Root or sudo access
- Basic NGINX knowledge

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/docker-bind-mounts.git
cd docker-bind-mounts```

2. Set environment variables:

export LOG_DST=/var/log/nginx/custom.host.access.log
```

3. Create configuration files:

```bash
touch ~/example.log
cat > ~/example.conf <<EOF
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/custom.host.access.log main;
    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html index.htm;
    }
}
EOF

```
